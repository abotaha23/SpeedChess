# Speed Chess game using x86 assembly

The idea was inspired by an android game called chezz,

it is a game like normal chess but with different rules 

to make it much more interesting. Search on it in 

google play store if you want to try it.



## the project was divided into two phases

### Phase 1:

In this phase we have created the game to be played by the two players on

the same computer, here is an image of the game being played
